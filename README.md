## Weak Points

- The use of Glassmorphism UI affects the overall performance of the App in low end devices. To fix this, i could run a fast benchmark to get scores which can be used to turn off animations or glass effect if needed.
- Even if it looks good in mobile devices & tablets, some issues may be present.
